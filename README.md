# bilevel-inverse-design-of-optical-switch

Code for Inverse Design of Optical Switch Based on Bilevel Optimization Inspired by Meta-Learning.

This repository contains two Colab notebooks, demonstrating two compact designs of 1-to-3 optical switch respectively with:
1. two small disk regions tunable, where the dielectric can be significantly varied
2. the whole design regions tunable, where the dielectric can be varied only a little

The Maxwell equation solver is based on finite-difference frequency-domain provided by [Ceviche](https://github.com/fancompute/ceviche). To understand the design workflow, [this workshop on inverse design](https://github.com/fancompute/workshop-invdesign) may be helpful.
